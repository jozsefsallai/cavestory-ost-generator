# Cave Story OST Generator

Electron app to generate custom OST version combinations for Cave Story+.

## Getting Started

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/jozsefsallai/cavestory-ost-generator/releases) from the Releases page, extract the archive, and run `cs_ost_generator.exe`.

## FAQ

### Why?

Because some people prefer different versions of each individual song in the OST, so this tool will help them generate something customized to their own liking. They can also export a configuration and import it for later use.

### Why Electron?

Because I'm a JavaScript junkie. I hate that I made it in Electron too, and I do have plans on rewriting it in a less resource-demanding framework/language.

### Why Sue?

Because I love Sue.
